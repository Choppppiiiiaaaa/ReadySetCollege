                  <p> In Junior Year summer I practiced for SAT and got a lot of books to practice with. I also went to the local library and used their resources frequently.
Something I’d say I recommend is making sure you know you're SAT deadlines because some colleges stop accepting and asking for them after Junior Year.

Be aware of what SAT subject tests your college of interest requires; know how many subject tests are required and/or what type.
</p>



<p> "Make sure you look out for application deadlines because many schools have different deadlines; however, most of them are going to be due before December of your senior year. Prices for applications are very high and if you're low income make sure to look out if you're eligible for free fee waivers. For UC and CSU’s  you are given four free fee waivers. Colleges are very strict on application deadlines and you may not submit your application late, so it is wise to submit it atleast a week early incase the website crashes. Most of the time colleges and universities are happy to answer questions for colleges so you don't be afraid to give them a call and ask.

                  <p> "I choose to go to college after 6 years in the military because I understood it would be the only way for me to pick a total different career field and be successful. I  was looking for a way to take care of my family. I wanted to create a way from my children to college right after high school. My overall experiences of college was mind blowing and it challenged a lot of my personal beliefs. It help me to open my understanding to the world around me. What truly worked for me was scheduling family activities and keeping my promises to myself and family. It helped to keep my moral up  allowing  me to deal with the difficult times. Keeping myself positive to achieve my goals and overcoming challenges."

                  <p> - </p>
                  <p> I chose my major (General Biology) based off of how much I enjoyed learning about it. There are a lot of different areas of study when it comes to Biology, and I have not chosen a specific area of study yet just because of how beautifully diverse it is. Astrobiology, Bioinformatics, Marine Biology, and Ecology are the ones that interest me the most now.
</p>
                    <p> My major was not always Biology. At first I wanted to teach English in Japan through a program called JET. But then I realized that I wanted to do more than teach English in Japan and that I would not want to live in Japan the rest of my life. So then I really thought about what else I could do that would make me happy while staying close to my family and helping other people. 
                    </p>
                    <p> As a junior in high school, I found another program called Global 30, which is a program that allows U.S Citizens to study in Japan for free in English, while earning their Baccalaureate degree. That was my goal. During this time I choose Biological Sciences as my major. And I was really ecstatic. However, I learned that some country’s degrees are not as valued or even considered at all when applying to jobs because of the differences in the country's curriculum. </p>
