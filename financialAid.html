                <br>
                <p> Financial Aid is the key to making college a possibility for those who cannot afford <thead>
                  expenses that comes with getting a higher education. There are several different ways
                  to get access to money for college that some students do not utilize. Here are a few
                  ways to make college a little more affordable.

                  <p style="font-size: 30px">Subsidized and Unsubsidized Loans</p>
                  <p style="font-size: 16px"> A subsidized loan is partially supported and paid for by the U.S. government. Direct Subsidized Loans are designed for lower-income,
                      undergraduate borrowers. The government pays the interest on the loan while you’re enrolled in school at least half-time, or if you enter
                      deferment or forbearance once it comes time to repay your student debt.
                    <p style="font-size: 16px"> Direct Unsubsidized Loans, on the other hand, do not offer additional financial assistance.
                      Even though they’re still offered by the federal government, the government won't pay the interest on unsubsidized student loans.
                      This is because it’s a general loan not based on financial need, so borrowers must repay their debt in full, interest and all. </p>
                    <br>

                  <p style="font-size: 30px">Aid from Schools</p>
                  <p style="font-size: 16px"> Schools also give financial aid apart from the government. Make sure with your school(s) to see how much is available
                    and if it is for everyone or just need-based!</p>
                    <br>

                  <p style="font-size: 30px">Federal Work Study</p>
                  <p style="font-size: 16px">Look into work study if your school offers this program. Federal
                    Work Study allows students to have part-time jobs on campus to help pay off their educational expenses such as tuition, room and board, etc. However, these
                    jobs are limited. We advise you to look into acquiring these jobs as soon as possible!</p>
                    <br>
                  <p style="font-size: 30px">Loan Forgiveness</p>
                  <p style="font-size: 16px">Loan forgiveness is a program that offers graduates a way to help pay off their loans.
                    In return for the government paying off a portion (or sometimes all) of a student's loans, that student must agree
                    to work a specific job for a certain amolunt of time. Althoughthis sounds like a dream, there is a catch to this type of aid. The jobs tend to be
                    ones that are unpopular and not very liked by others. Look more into this before settling in to make sure that you can tolerate (or even enjoy)
                    your position given!</p>

                  <p style="font-size: 30px">Grants</p>
                  <p style="font-size: 16px">A grant is an amount of money that a government or
                      other institution gives to an individual or to an organization for a particular
                      purpose such as education or home improvements. This type of aid allows students
                    to have access to money without having to pay the government back. </p>

                  <p style="font-size: 30px">Scholarships</p>
                  <p style="font-size: 16px">This type of aid is sort of like a christmas present! Students are rewarded free money depending on the
                      requirements that were made without having to pay them back! However, you must not forget the deadlines and keep a look out on what is required for the different
                      scholarships that you choose to apply for. Also, visit your community centers and libraries to check in on local scholarships. Those tend to be the ones that people
                          are less likely to apply for. For help on applying for scholarships: </p>
